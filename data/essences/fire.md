tier: initiate
isActive: true
isPassive: false

tier: initiate
isActive: false
isPassive: true
isSpell: false

### Flame Lash
```yaml
id: fire_initiate_flame_lash
tier: initiate
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false
```

You can use your action to create a whip-like tendril of fire that extends up to 15 feet. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes fire damage equal to 4d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The intense heat also causes the target to become dazzled, giving them disadvantage on their next attack roll.

---

### Inferno Disengage
```yaml
id: fire_initiate_inferno_disengage
tier: initiate
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false
```

When you use the Disengage action, you create a burst of fire around you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 fire damage and catches fire. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage.

---

### Heart Crusher Grip (Nilo)
```yaml
id: fire_initiate_heart_crusher_grip
tier: initiate
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false
```

As an action, you can target one bloodied creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, their heart is crushed and they die instantly.

---

## Adept Tier

### Blazing Presence
```yaml
id: fire_adept_blazing_presence
tier: adept
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false

id: fire_adept_embers_resilience
tier: adept
isActive: true

tier: adept
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false
```

When you take the Dash action, you can leave a trail of fire in your wake. For the duration of your movement, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the 10-foot-wide line of fire you create takes fire damage equal to your total fire essences. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a success. This trail lasts for 1 minute or until you choose to end it.

---

### Scorched Ground

id: fire_adept_scorched_ground
tier: adept
isActive: true
isPassive: false
isSpell: false
isCantrip: false
```

As an action, you can cause a 20-foot radius area on the ground to become superheated within 120 feet of you for 1 minute. Creatures that start their turn in this area take fire damage equal to 4d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The area is difficult terrain, and the fire persists even if you move away from it.
